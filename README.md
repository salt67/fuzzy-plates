# License Plate Search

Look up license plates in a list, matching even when characters just look alike, like O/0, B/8, etc.

## How to use

Use the site [here](https://salt67.github.io/fuzzy-plates/), or download [fuzzy-plates.html](dist/fuzzy-plates.html) to a file.

Paste in data from a spreadsheet that has a list of vehicles with license plates. If there is a column containing "plate", that is the column that will be searched. If there are columns containing "color", "make", or "model" they will be used to summarize the color, make, and model of the vehicles.
